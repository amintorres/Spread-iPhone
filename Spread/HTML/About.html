<p>
Spread is a marketplace for news and creative photography.

<strong>
News photos
<br>
<br>
</strong>
<p>
Spread is platform that allows citizens to capture newsworthy photographs from their mobile devices and make them available to blogs and news organizations for immediate purchase.
</p>
<p>
Photos are released under two standardized licenses, RFW (Ready For Web) and  RFP (Ready For Print).  Both are available for anyone to purchase at a flat rate. Magazines, news organizations, ad agencies and individuals can also submit photo requests to reach out to the Spread photographer community. Photographers can then submit photos against these requests, which becomes a pool of freshly made images from where the photo requester can choose.
</p>
<p>
All photo requests are pre-paid to ensure that the financial transaction between the photo requester and the photographer is immediate.

<strong>Korbin Hoffman</strong>
Co-Founder and Tech Lead
<br>
Korbin Hoffman is the technical architect behind Spread. A hardcore PHP lover turned Ruby guru. Korbin is a visionary who can go beyond translating design into a working application. Korbin has built a robust system designed from the ground up to support the needs of our news and photo request network. A fast iterator, Korbin loves perfectly formatted syntax and can always write in one line what one usually writes in two or three. Prior to Spread, Korbin was responsible for the architecture behind listedplaces and Archup. While he was still in high school, Korbin led development of a social networking and memorabilia e-commerce platform for professional athletes such as Randy Moss, Allen Iverson, Ryan Bader, and others.
<br>
<br>
When Korbin is not behind the computer, he enjoys a good movie and taking photos with his Android phone.

<strong>Jez Coulson</strong>
is an internationally renowned reportage artist whose photojournalism has won many accolades and has appeared in the world's leading magazines
His assignments have taken him across continents: from the frozen coal mines of Siberia to the extreme heat of the Negev desert. From the teeming rain forests of Ghana to the windswept emptiness of the South Atlantic Falkland Islands. He has covered the slums of Bombay and the Place of Westminster.  Glamorous parties in Cannes to the horror of war in the Congo. His pictures show joy at the bringing down of the Berlin wall and elation at the election of Nelson Mandela. But also the brutality of ethnic cleansing. Shock and sadness in the aftermath and rubble of the Twin Towers. Devastation around the Gulf in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill.
