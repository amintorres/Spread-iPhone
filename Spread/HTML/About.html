About
</h1>

<p>Spread is a marketplace for news and creative photography.</p>

<p>Spread has two main offerings, photo requests and news images.</p>

<p><b>Photo requests</b> enable creative, news organizations as well as individuals with the ability to post photo assignments directly to photographers. Photographers can then submit photo responses to these requests. Photo request can be both for news and commercial photography. The request owner describes what she needs via a photo brief, she must state the intended use for the images requested. Submitting a photo response to a request implies that you agree with the intended use stated by the request owner.</p>

<p>All photo request are prepaid to ensure participating photographers do get paid when their images are selected.</p>

<p><b>News photos</b> are images taken with our mobile app, consumers, prosumers and professional seasoned photographers can upload images of newsworthy events for immediate purchase. Bloggers and news organizations can purchase these images at two standardized prices and licenses, RFW (Ready For Web) and RFP (Ready For Print).</p>

<p>Specially for bloggers who can&rsquo;t afford to purchase images we allow them to use all photos from Spread free of charge via an embed code ensuring that photographers get credited properly. While these photos will always be free, we encourage, but not require you to make a purchase from time to time. This helps us reward and keep our participating photographers motivated to continue to contribute images. If you are a blogger who uses images from Spread, we encourage you to submit images of your own for others to use.</p>
